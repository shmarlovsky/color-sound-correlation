[Good tutorial for installing openCV for python in Ubuntu](http://www.pyimagesearch.com/2015/06/22/install-opencv-3-0-and-python-2-7-on-ubuntu/)

Currently openCV is used with python3.4, but essentia has only binding for python2.7

To run any script:
```
#!sh
python2 essentia_test.py
python3 1color_test_correlation.py
```
